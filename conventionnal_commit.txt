feat     = A commit of feat means you’ve added or removed src code, but since you started with 1000% coverage, something is either not covered by tests or tests broke.
fix      = A commit of fix means that if you were to add a new test reproducing a bug, it would not pass. In this case, the commit will make that test pass.
refactor = A commit of refactor means that you changed src code but unlike feat no tests broke and no lines lost coverage.
perf     = A commit of perf, like refactor means changed src code, but in this case performance metrics go up.
style    = A commit of style, like refactor means changed src code, but instead of actual code changes, only formatting & whitespace are changed. In other words, anything a code formatter or linter changes
docs     = A commit of docs usually means a change in markdown files. I also add as docs changes, comments in src code when only comments are changed.
test     = A commit of test means changes in test files. If you weren’t at 100% code coverage, now you would be. If you had failing tests, they would be passing.
ci       = A commit of ci means changes related to Continuous Integration (usually yml and other configuration files).
build    = A commit of build means changes related to the build of the project and dependencies. (Basically, anything that can change the build step of the application.)
chore    = A commit of chore is most likely something that doesn’t fit the other possible types. It shouldn’t change any src, test, build, or docs related files.
revert   = A commit of revert simply reverts changes made in another commit.
